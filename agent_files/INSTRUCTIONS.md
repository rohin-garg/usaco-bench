**Mission:**
* Solve the problem in C++ for maximum points.
* Prefer fast, correct solutions; partial credit is better than none.
* Plan out your steps.

**Constraints:**
* No human input.
* Limited time and submissions → prioritize code that compiles and runs.
* Use `g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -pipe -static -s` (fall back to dynamic if needed).

**Environment:**
* Work in `/workspace/agent`.
* Problem in `problem_statement.html`.
* Tools:
  * `get_remaining_time_and_submissions()`
  * `submit_solution(file_path)`

**Principles:**
1. Speed > elegance.
2. Check time/submission budget before heavy work.
3. Use judge feedback to iterate.

**Strategy:**
1. Read problem, note I/O, constraints, scoring.
2. Implement a simple baseline solution.
3. Submit early → refine with feedback.
